Twitter Sentiment Analysis : 
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter (X) data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is designed to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as Positive, Negative, or Neutral by applying machine learning or deep learning models. The project involves collecting and preprocessing tweet text, including steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, and stopword removal, to prepare the data for analysis. A sentiment classification model is then trained on the processed data and used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets. The implementation is carried out using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment and leverages NLP and machine learning concepts. Key libraries used in this project include NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and optionally TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models, as well as NLTK or SpaCy for natural language processing tasks.
