# 🐦 Twitter (X) Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis on Twitter (X) data** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is an important NLP task used to understand public opinion and emotions expressed in textual data.  
In this project, Twitter tweets are analyzed to determine their underlying sentiment. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and sentiment prediction on unseen tweets.

The implementation is carried out using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook environment**, making it suitable for academic learning and experimentation.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   - Twitter (X) tweet dataset is used for analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing text
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Text cleaning

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converting text data into numerical features (e.g., Bag of Words / TF-IDF)

4. **Model Training**
   - Machine learning or deep learning models are trained on processed data

5. **Sentiment Prediction**
   - The trained model predicts sentiment for new, unseen tweets
